    "### 1) What is a parameter?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>> Parameters are the names  that appear in the functiomn define \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What is correlation?What is correlation?\n",
    ">>> Correlation is a statistical technique for determining the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "    What does negative correlation mean?\n",
    "    >>Nagative correlationship if 'x' is incresing and 'Y' decresing that is negative corealation \n",
    "    \n",
    "3) Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>> Machin learning is a branch of artificial intalligence that understand the pattern of data and create self learning madule capble of predicting outcomes and classifing the data.\n",
    " understand the data pattern is the main componunt of machin learning.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4) How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
    " >> The lower the loss, the better a model .The loss is calculated on training and validation and its interperation is how well the model is doing for these two sets\n",
    "\n",
    " 5)  What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
    " >>>  Continuous data is basically whole number and decimal number and in categorical data have string values that os the main defferancec between both \n",
    " \n",
    "6) How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common t\n",
    "  echniques?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> for refer categorical variavle in machine learning required to convert the data into categorical format as wen refer the data to machin learning modling\n",
    "\n",
    "7) What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
    ">>> there are 2 envoroment to create the module 1 is traning where can train the modual and secount one id test the module. can't directly test the  module without train the modual.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)  What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> sklearn.preprocessing is basically processing od data modeleling where define the variable X,Y to train and test module.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) What is a Test set?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> To test the data in modeling required dataset is unique and train the modual to find the data pattern \n",
    "\n",
    "10) How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
    "How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Data spliting is initial stage of the data modeling there are require data split in 2 set one in independant data and dependant data in data set dependant variable should be 1 but indepent variable can 1 and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "11) Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> IN EDA is bassicaly cleaning and filtering the data to modeling in this 'isnull' value duplicate value drop columns. data teyes all the point are nessesurry to do to ready data to modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "12) What is correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>Correlation is a statistical technique for determining the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "   \n",
    "13) What does negative correlation mean?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>Nagative correlationship if 'x' is incresing and 'Y' decresing that is negative corealation.\n",
    "\n",
    "14) How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> to find the corerelation require at leat 2 variable if assume area of house and price of house.\n",
    "\n",
    "if area of house is increases also price of house increases that is possitive correlation if area of house increses and price of house decrese that is the negative correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "15) What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
    ">> Correlation measures the linear relation between variables in a possitive corelation. when the value of one variable in going up and depedant variable values also going up also one variable value goning down and dependent variable value also going down  that is possitive correlation \n",
    "when tha value of one variable going up and another are going down and one variable going down and another is going up thats negative correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Causation mean one variable directly effected to change in other variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "16) What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example\n",
    ">> An optimizer in machine learning is an algorithm that adjusts model parameters to minimize or maximize a specific objective function, such as minimizing loss in neural network training, by iteratively updating parameter values based on gradients or other criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "17) What is sklearn.linear_model ?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>  Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, making it a powerful tool for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "18) What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
    ">> he fit method is a core part of the Scikit-Learn library. Itâ€™s used to train a wide range of machine learning models. train data as argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "19) What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
    ">>> Model predict generate prediction besed fited model its take the model parameter and apply on new data   \n",
    "\n",
    "20) What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
    ">>> weight height date are countiounse variable string variable consider as categorical variable  \n",
    "\n",
    "21) What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n",
    ">>> featur scaling tries to bring all the features on the same scale. interpritation is essyer.optimization become faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "22) How do we perform scaling in Python?\n",
    ">> Feature Scaling or Standardization: It is a step of Data Pre Processing that is applied to independent variables or features of data. It helps to normalize the data within a particular range.\n",
    "\n",
    "23) What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
    "SKlearn. is library which use to build machine learing algoritham. ferarures scaling, standerdization, encoding, handling missing value  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "24) How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
    "Data splitting based on ratio 80 for training and 20 for testing. this process automatically done by sklearn train test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "25) Explain data encoding?\n",
    ">>Encoding means convert the categorical columns in n umeric columns. \n",
